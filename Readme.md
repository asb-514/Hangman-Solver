# Hangman Solver
## Overview

This repository contains a sophisticated Hangman Solver designed to guess the next letter in a Hangman word puzzle with high accuracy. The solver employs algorithmic strategies, making it an efficient and reliable tool for solving Hangman games. The project integrates the Trexquant API to facilitate game-related functionalities.

## Features

- **Dynamic Guessing Strategy:** The solver uses synchronization weighting, penalty consideration, and a dynamic decay factor to predict the most likely next letter.
- **High Accuracy:** Designed to improve guessing accuracy over multiple rounds, the solver adapts to different word patterns.
- **Trexquant API :** The Trexquant API is used to facilitate game-related aspects, such as managing word lists and handling game sessions, but is not used within the core algorithm.
- **Customizable:** The algorithm can be fine-tuned to handle different word lengths, letter distributions, and guess limitations.

## How It Works

1. **Input Word Pattern:** The solver requires the current word pattern, where unknown letters are represented by underscores (e.g., `_a__man`).
2. **Generate Next Guess:** The solver analyzes the pattern and makes an educated guess for the next letter.
3. **Iterate:** As the game progresses and more letters are revealed, the solver adjusts its strategy to improve accuracy.
